 
We used six statistical methods for prediction: (i) LASSO devel- oped by Tibshirani (1996) and implemented in the GlmNet/R pro- gram (Friedman et al., 2010); (ii) Hendersonâ€™s (1975) BLUP adopted to genomic data analysis (VanRaden, 2008) and implemented in our own R program (Xu, 2013); (iii) SSVS developed by George and McCulloch (1993); (iv) support vector machine using the radial basis function (SVM-RBF); (v) support vector machine  using the polynomial kernel function (SVP-POLY); and (vi) partial least squares (PLS). The SSVS method is also called Bayes B (Meuwissen et al., 2001) and was implemented using an R package called BGLR (Perez and de los Campos 2014). The two SVM methods were implemented in an R program called kernlab (Karatzoglou et al., 2004). The PLS was implemented using an R package called pls (Mevik and Wehrens, 2007).
